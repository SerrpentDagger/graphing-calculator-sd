## Can't Launch .jar File
You can't launch the .jar file by double-clicking. This means your Java installation is not valid.
### Verifying Java is installed:
You can verify that Java is installed by opening a command terminal and running the command ```java -version```.
You should see a message summarizing the active Java version. If running that command results in an error message saying that the java command is not
recognized (or similar), then your Java installatin is invalid, and you should run the installer found [here](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
### Using the right version:
It may be that you have the correct version of Java installed, but that a different one is being used to launch the application. I need to investigate the behaviour here
a little more in order to write something useful. I don't even know if the wrong one will be used if the right one is available. Gimme a minute, as they say.

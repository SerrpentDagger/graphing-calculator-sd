## Crashes With Access Violation
Access violations happen when a program tries to access an adress in memory which it's not allowed to touch. The JVM will instantly crash, and produces its own
error file next to the GCSD jar. This shouldn't happen under any normal circumstances when running GCSD, so if you encounter this error, it's probably because you're running
the wrong version of Java. Please see [this page](java.md) for more details.

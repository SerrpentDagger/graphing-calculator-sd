## Updating GCSD

A given release will have a combination of symbols/keywords from below.
Each is a straightforward instruction for what needs to be copied from the new version to your current installation.
My reccommendation for updating is to download the new version's .zip file, extract it into a convenient directory, and then follow the instructions indicated by the symbols/keywords.
You can then delete the remaining portions of the new installation, since you've updated the old one.

### Symbols
- \*: Required in order for the update to work.
- ^: Recommended for non-essential, visual asset improvements.

### Keywords
- jar: Replace the current 'GraphingCalculator...jar" file with the new one.
- <data folder name>: When the name of a folder in 'data/' is written, the instruction is to merge the new 'data/<name>' folder with the old one by dragging the new one into 'data/'. Replace the old conflicting files if prompted, unless they're ones you've added yourself and want to keep.

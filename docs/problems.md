## Problem-Solver
This interactive set of pages should hopefully help you in solving any problems you might be encountering with Graphing Calculator SD.
I will be adding entries as potential issues become apparent. Note that as a single developer with limited testing devices, it's difficult to establish a comprehensive list without user input.
### Please select a category:
- [Can't open .jar file](problems/java)
- [GCSD crashes](problems/crash.md)
- [GCSD opens, but...](problems/opens-but)
